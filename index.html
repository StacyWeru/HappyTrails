         <h3>Tropical destinations</h3>
         To start off there are very may tropical destinations that you could go to but why don't we start with our home-turf or somewhere close to home.
         <li>
             <ul>Lamu Archipelago,Kenya</ul>
                 <p>Lamu is a collection of islands located off the coast of Kenya north of Mombasa .The beaches of Shela Village on the main island offer the quintessential Indian Ocean ingredients: powdery white sands, excellent snorkeling, and clear blue waters. Founded by the Swahili people nearly 700 years ago, Lamu Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Kenya's oldest settlements. Its quiet, narrow streets are fascinating to explore and the fact that there are no cars available for visitors on the island just enhances the sense of stepping back in time. </p>

            <ul>Anse Source D'Argent ,Seychelles</ul>
              <p>A bit further from home is the Anse Source D'Argent in Seychelles. The Seychelles archipelago has long been one of the world's most romantic destinations and its beaches feature frequently in global Top 10 lists. One of the island nation's most famous beaches is Anse Source D’Argent, located on the island of La Digue. This stretch of pure white sand is perhaps the archetypal paradise beach, with dramatic boulders, shallow turquoise waters and gently curving palm trees. It's a great place to soak up the sunshine or go snorkeling, although its perfect beauty also makes it a popular stop for visiting day-trippers. </p>

             <ul>Mnemba Island ,Tanzania</ul>
                <p>Located off the north coast of Tanzania, Mnemba is a private Indian Ocean island and part of the historic Zanzibar Archipelago. The island offers the best snorkeling and scuba diving in Zanzibar, and there are ample opportunities for whale watching, swimming with dolphins and whale shark encounters in the island's clear, warm waters. It's also the perfect destination for a romantic honeymoon or anniversary celebration.</p>

             <ul>Cozumel , Mexico</ul>
               <p>Cozumel beaches are free all year long, so you can spend entire days enjoying the sun and spend almost nothing. If you prefer the comfort of a pool, you can get a day pass at one of the luxury local resorts - which will allow you full use of their pool and sun chairs without the cost of sleeping there.<br>The Arrecifes de Cozumel National Park is the world's second-largest coral reef system, perfect for some diving at very affordable prices.<br>For a quick bite or snacks on the go, nothing beats a local mercado - little markets that appear unannounced in plazas, where you can get not only great souvenirs and local art but also traditional fare, such as tamales and quesadillas, for very little money.</p>

             <ul>Costa Rica</ul>
               <p>Costa Rica is not necessarily always a cheap tropical getaway, but arriving at the right time of year will definitely save a lot of money. From May to mid-December, Costa Rica experiences what's known as the "green season" - lots of rain, thick cloud forests on green mountainsides, and budget-friendly surf breaks at a time when the big crowds mostly stay away. Don't let the rain scare you, though - it's still warm, and you'll get plenty of sunny days to enjoy the beach.</p>

           <li>
               <ul>Johannesburg,South Africa</ul>
                  <p>Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa, is surprisingly one of the cheapest cities in Africa. The city is relatively rich due to its large gold and diamond deposit around the city, this somewhat explains the low cost of living which has led to cheaper goods and services. There are several impressive attractions that are worth visiting. Johannesburg is a lively and exciting urban city with interesting activities at reduced prices.</p>

                <ul>Cairo ,Egypt</ul>
                   <p>Cairo has become a friendly city, which attracts a lot of tourists and travellers from all over the world. You’ll find thousands of tourists wandering around the famous Giza Pyramids and strolling round the Khan el-Khalili market’s narrow alleys looking for souvenirs to purchase. Cairo is amazingly cheap in many ways and the low prices have drawn a lot of people for holiday. You will find affordable hotels and restaurants around, and cheap activities that will keep you glued to the beautiful old city.</p>

                <ul>New Orleans ,Louisiana,USA</ul>
                   <p>New Orleans is known for colorful nightlife, a bursting festival calendar and a decadent local cuisine — but the Big Easy is also an undercover gem for budget travelers. Let’s start with the basics. Most NOLA must-dos are free: people-watching in the French Quarter, house peeping in the Garden District and bar hopping the live music venues on Frenchman Street.</p>

                <ul>Jamaica , Caribbean Sea</ul>
                     <p>Though Jamaica is a legendary beach destination, 2020 will be the year to discover Kingston, an untapped, culturally rich capital of the Caribbean. Still rough around the edges but with a soul that is impossible to resist, Kingston is the place to experience the heartbeat of Jamaica, in ways simply not possible from within a beach resort — and for a much cheaper price tag. Rhythm rocks the streets from sunup to sundown.</p>

                <ul>Tallinn ,Estonia</ul>
                     <p> Only a short ferry ride away from Finland, Tallinn is a cheap alternative to visiting Northern European cities such as Helsinki or Stockholm. Accommodations run for a fraction of the price compared to most of Europe, and public transportation is easy to navigate, as well as cost-efficient. Make sure to pay a visit to Tallinn’s UNESCO-protected medieval old town, a preserved walled area with many restaurants and shops. </p>
